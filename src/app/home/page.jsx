I played in the most important clubs in Europe. And for me now is a new challenge. As you mentioned in Asia, I'm glad for that Al-Nassr gave me this opportunity to show and develop, not only for the football, but also for the generation, the young generation, the women's generation as well, for the young boys. And for me, it's a challenge. But in the same way, I feel very, very happy and very proud."
